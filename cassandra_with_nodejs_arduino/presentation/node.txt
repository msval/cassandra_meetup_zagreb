Node - range of what you can do with it

node.js is not in 1.0

Who's using it today:
	- wallmart, ebay, dow joes, twitter, microsoft, linkedin (entire mobile backend)

node.js is a little bit different
at it's core it's a wrapper around google's v8 - javascript interpreter

not one big server that has everything you ever need, but includes modules as you
need them by using something called npm
	- http server
	- file system
	- utilities

node.js is non blocking
	- operation is sent to event queue
	- event loop gives it to something to process it

doSomeIO(- we are passing in a function, usually called callback);
doSomeDBStuff();
doALittle();

doSomeIO(function () {
	doSomeDatabaseStuff();
});

doALittle();

npm - repository of package you include, they are called modules, express for instance is a module

usually socket.io and some kind of chat etc.

at the very top, fs = require(fs) - it's just using fs core

npm is the core of what community adds to node.js, similar to ruby gems
npm is growing insanely fast, 100 000 000 modules (100 millions)

node.js built in debugger, node inspector, connects to crome debugger
eclipse, ties into native node.js debugger
webstorm

express the base of how we build more web sites, jade

socket io, async - helping handle the async,

promises - Q

database engines, mongoDB (mongoose is an orm),
